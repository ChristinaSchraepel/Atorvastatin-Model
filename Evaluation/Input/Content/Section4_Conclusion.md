A whole-body PBPK model for atorvastatin acid has been successfully developed and verified integrating data of 15 clinical trials.The model is able to describe and predict atorvastatin acid plasma concentration-time profiles after single and multiple oral administrations across the range of 1 to 80 mg in healthy subjects.The final PBPK model comprises metabolism via CYP3A4 and if present, also metabolism via CYP3A5 as well as transport processes via BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, and P-gp. Moreover, the established PBPK model enriches the openly accessible PBPK model library by a new CYP3A4 and OATP1B1/1B3 substrate.
